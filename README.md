# 🐾 BASIC OOP CONCEPTS

A simple Python project demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts like **class design**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism** using a fun "Pet Simulator" theme.

## 📚 Assignment Overview

### 🧱 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a base class `Pet` with attributes like `name`, `age`, and `species`
- Used constructors to initialize pets with unique values
- Used encapsulation with getter and setter methods for private attributes
- Added inheritance with subclasses: `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`, `Fish`
- Each subclass includes specific attributes and methods to make the pets come to life

### 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- All pet classes implement the `move()` and `speak()` methods differently
- Demonstrated polymorphism: same method name, different behaviors in each class

---

## 🚀 Features

- Object-Oriented Design (OOP)
- Inheritance and Encapsulation
- Polymorphic behavior through `move()` and `speak()`
- Beginner-friendly structure with clean code and comments
